To solve keyword ciphers:
-Run a frequency analysis to find e's letter etc
Replace those letters and gradually encode them in
Then deduce other words

Vinegre cipher:
- Find spaces between letters eg. a
- Deduce length of keyword - then make a new string with every (length)th letter
- Run a frequency aalysis and decode via caesar cipher
- Deduce and replace

Transposition cipher:
- FInd length of string and try to find table width
- Look for cribs

If the frequency does not look like english, it is a polyalphabetic cipher.
